	This ruleset.xml is purely for backwards compatibility prior to the repo restructuring in:
	https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards/pull/194

	As part of the repo restructuring, the subset rulesets standards for:
	 - WordPress-Core
	 - WordPress-VIP
	 - WordPress-Extra
	All of these became referenceable by name when passing the standard to phpcs.
	To make use of them, you need to add this WordPress-Coding-Standards project
	to the PHPCS installed paths.
